#DREAMS

###Get database from sqlite to pg
###Get app from Sinatra to Rails
###Create layout

-First want to scrape the data into a tmp folder
-Then seed it all into database on first run



##Things that would be cool to compare/quantify/calculate
*Compare premiums and benefits across age groups, states, etc.
*Deductible + monthly premium costs, disparities in annual expenses with the cost of medical necessities held constant
                                         > so like, annual drug costs, average doctors visits, etc from previous year factored in


#So basically just want bare minimum chart.js set up, and as I go maybe figure out better ways

Here is all of the plan data to add, at some point:                     Here's plan data I won't need:
